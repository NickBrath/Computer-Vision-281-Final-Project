# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Methods

## Data preparation

## Feature Engineering

From 
- local binary patterns (17) (LBP)
- completed LBP
- local phase quantization (LPQ)
- gray-level co-occurance matric (CLCM
- threshold adjacency statistics (TAS)
- one keypoint descriptor named ORB


## UMAP
It is like t-SNE. Works on dimensionality reduction and
